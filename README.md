# generator-fx-prototype

> [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) generator

This is a yeoman generator in order to make the build process for
prototyping animations simpler. It is based solely on my own
developmental preferences but there is room for customization.

## Pre-requisites
• CoffeeScript
• yeoman
• grunt-cli
• node
• npm


## Getting Started
First yeoman, CoffeeScript, and grunt-cli is needed for installation

```bash
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g coffee-script
$ npm install -g grunt-cli
```

### Installation 

To install generator-fx-prototype from npm, run:

```bash
$ npm install -g generator-fx-prototype
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```bash
$ yo fx-prototype
```

### Options

you would like to install.
